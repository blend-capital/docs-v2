This covers the Lending Pool contract, Backstop contract, Pool Factory contract, and Emitter contract. The bounty will not be awarded for any of the issues covered in the [#known-issues](tech-docs/potential-improvements.md#known-issues "mention") section of the docs.

      * Medium: Vulnerabilities that may result in denial of service scenarios or degraded usability.
      * Low: Low probability vulnerabilities, which are still exploitable but require extenuating circumstances or undue risk.
      * Info: Best practices to mitigate future security risks. These are classified as general findings.
